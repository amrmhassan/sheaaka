# fix the store offers by creating OfferModel(productId, storeId)

--now i need a way to store the offers,
-- 1- by storing them on both the product model and the stores as references to them on the database emulator
-- 2- or by storing them on a provider and getting all offers and store their references on

# i prefer storing them in a const variable(database emulator) then getting them by their ids

and i will store on the store and product if the offer id

---

# store offers on the store model and store on the product model the date of the offer end

and don't make and offer provider
