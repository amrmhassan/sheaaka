--when uploading products by a store he can add them ProductsProvider or store them locally then upload them when he has internet connection
--you can add a list to productModel that will have it's props, if it is a trend, offer, etc, ['offer', 'trend' , ...]

-- stores can add many images as they want but on there google drive, u can make this option for them (after you implement this, you can let them add multiple images for each color available in the product collection, so when the user chooses one color , images collection change for each chosen color)
